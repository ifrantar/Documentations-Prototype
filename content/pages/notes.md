The benefits of providing documentation and training guides to our clients via a web documentation platform, highly outweight those via mediums such as powerpoint, pdf or a word document shoot via email. Surely, you can argue that a doc in the latter formats could be shared via Sharepoint, but the experience to consume the content won't be the same:

* It's aligned with the medium and nature of the product we are offering to our clients.
* It's cost and time effective as there always be one version and less effort to update.
* We can change it on real-time and if sections are commonly shared across clients, one change could be instant on all instances.
* It's resonsive. Users can read and go through this documentation on their mobile, tablet, etc.
* We can enrichg these guides with embeded videos ie. walk-through screencasts, link images, webinars, etc or any type of medium available to be published on a web page.
* It can be incorporated in the application using the same our clients have for the app.
* We can incorportate a commenting system allowing us for clients to provide feedback in the documents themselves.
* It's super simple as it is literally a repository with pages.
