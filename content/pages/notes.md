Benefits of providing documentation and training guides to our clients via a web documentation platform:

* It's aligned with the medium and nature of the product we are offering to our clients.
* It's cost and time effective as there always be one version and less effort to update and time a team member to spend tweaking the design or asking for feedback.
* We can change it on real-time and if sections are commonly shared across clients, one change could be instant on all instances.
* It's resonsive. Users can read and go through this documentation on their mobile, tablet, etc.
* We can enrichg these guides with embeded videos ie. walk-through screencasts, link images, webinars, etc or any type of medium available that can be published on a web page.
* It can be incorporated in the application using the same access our clients currently have for the app.
* We can incorporate a commenting system allowing us for clients to provide feedback in the documents themselves.
* It's super simple as it is literally a repository with pages and the technology behind is javascript.

Improvements that can be made:

* Connect to a CMS system such as Netlify CMS. It wouldn't be too much of an effort. This would make it even easier for someone like Sean to create content as in a blogging platform.
