Once a base pricing analysis has been set up, the Analytics Suite caters for extensive scenario analysis. Scenario analysis can be performed simply by altering pricing parameters. Once applied, the Trading page will exhibit a refreshed IRR calculation, as well as a yield and cashflow analysis.

### Financing

* The application of financing parameters to an analysis will deliver a Levered IRR output
* Financing parameters can be changed to examine the influence of financing terms changes on the Levered IRR e.g., a higher balloon payment

### Fees

* Pre-defined Aergo fee structures relating to acquisition, rent management, disposition, remarketing and off lease are captured in the knowledge base and can be applied to the analysis
* An additional output section will be delivered for Fee Breakout and fees will also be factored into the NPV calculation and cashflow forecast

### Maintenance

* Maintenance related parameters that can be adjusted include engine interdependencies, maintenance inflation and maintenance policy used
* In the Trading outputs, changes to these parameters will influence the maintenance proponent of the NPV calculation and any maintenance cashflows will be viewable in the cashflow analysis graph
* The Cost to Full Life and Maintenance Adjustment sections of the platform provide the best opportunity to review changes to maintenance parameters because they visually capture maintenance events and maintenance compensation balances

### Future leases

* Using the top ribbon: Commercial → Future Lease →Create New Future Lease
* Once the new lease details have been input, select the lease as a follow-on lease to be included in the analysis from the parameters on the right-hand side
* Transition costs & freighter conversions can be included here.
