### Analysis Forecast

The Analysis Forecast section of the platform allows the user to view all maintenance, lease and pricing outputs in the form of a table that is exportable to Excel as a CSV.

To use the analysis forecast filtering functionality:

* Using the top ribbon: Fundamentals → Analysis Forecast
* The pricing analysis to be viewed is selected using the drop down in the top right-hand side (Figure 5 – “Pricing 1” is the scenario selected)
* The desired outputs are selected using the Filter – the user can apply filters relating to maintenance, the contracted lease and the pricing analysis
* The output table will populate once the filters are applied, and this table can be exported to excel using the CSV button – as can be seen in Figure 5
